In the realm of OpenGL development, the popularity of libraries can be gauged by how well they support developers in creating graphics applications, 
managing OpenGL context, handling user input, and interfacing with different hardware and operating systems. 
Some libraries are designed to complement OpenGL by providing higher-level functionalities,
while others are essential for the basic operation of any OpenGL application.
